## Sprint 2.1 – JavaScript Practice

This project contains a collection of JavaScript exercises organized into 7 thematic blocks. Each block focuses on a specific concept or feature of the language, and all exercises are linked through a single HTML file for easy testing in the browser console.


📁 Structure
The HTML file loads the following JavaScript files:
html
<script src="./exercici11.js"></script> <!-- Arrow Functions -->
<script src="./exercici12.js"></script> <!-- Ternary Operator -->
<script src="./exercici13.js"></script> <!-- Callbacks -->
<script src="./exercici14.js"></script> <!-- Rest & Spread -->
<script src="./exercici15.js"></script> <!-- Array Transformations -->
<script src="./exercici16.js"></script> <!-- Array Loops -->
<script src="./exercici17.js"></script> <!-- Promises & Async/Await -->
